<h2>Join the Lab</h2>

Thanks for your interest in the Laverty Lab! Funded graduate student and postdoc openings in our group will be listed below as well as advertised on job boards, such as the [Texas A&M Wildlife and Fisheries Sciences job board](https://wfscjobs.tamu.edu/job-board/). 

While a background in the kind of work we do is always a leg up in hiring, Theresa particularly values independence, curiosity, and some awe at the natural world. We aim to cultivate a lab culture and scientific practice that is equitable and welcoming of diversity in all its dimensions, including class, gender identity and sexual orientation, race and ethnicity, and life experiences -- please see the note on [values](values.html). New Mexico is home to 23 Tribal Nations, and our lab is committed to providing opportunities to Indigenous students.

## Prospective undergrads:

The Laverty Lab is always willing to work with eager and motivated NMSU undergraduate researchers. If you are interested in working in our lab, please send Theresa an email at [tlaverty {at} nmsu.edu](mailto:tlaverty@nmsu.edu) or stop by her office, Knox Hall 127, to discuss your research interests and any potential project ideas. Also consider visiting the links listed at the end of this page to explore other research opportunities beyond our group.

## Prospective graduate students:

M.S. and Ph.D. students at New Mexico State University are typically supported by a mix of teaching and research assistantships. Right now, both M.S. and Ph.D. students receive a ~$2,000 / month stipend. Theresa budgets for the cost of tuition and health insurance whenever possible in grant applications. The Laverty Lab's ability to take on graduate students (and particularly Ph.D. students) is therefore contingent on the availability of funding. She will not support students' applications without adequate funding.

[This publication](https://doi.org/10.1002/bes2.2029) provides a nice overview of what applying to grad school looks like in our field. We highly recommend that you review it before contacting Theresa (or any other potential advisor).

**All funded graduate positions in the lab are full at this time.** However, if you are interested in securing your own funding as you apply for graduate programs and research interests overlap, Theresa is happy to assist with fellowship applications to programs, such as the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/), the [US Fulbright Program](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/), and the [DOE Computational Science Graduate Fellowship](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/). Similarly, Theresa would be happy to work with prospective international students on applications for the [Fulbright Foreign Student Program](https://foreign.fulbrightonline.org/about/foreign-student-program), a [WWF Russell E. Train Fellowship](https://www.worldwildlife.org/projects/russell-e-train-fellowships), or other opportunities. If you want to pursue a fellowship application, send an email to [tlaverty {at} nmsu.edu](mailto:tlaverty@nmsu.edu) containing a short explanation of an idea you'd like to pursue, a pathway for pursuing it (e.g., a link to a funding source), and a CV with contact information for at least three references.

## Prospective postdocs:

**No funded postdoc positions in the lab are available at this time.** However, Theresa is happy to work with any interested individuals on related fellowship or grant applications to secure independent funding (via a [NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology](https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/postdoctoral-research-fellowships-biology-prfb), a [David H. Smith Conservation Research Fellowship](https://conbio.org/mini-sites/smith-fellows), a [Lâ€™Oreal USA Women in Science Fellowship](https://www.loreal.com/en/usa/pages/group/fwis/), etc.). If you are interested in pursuing this option, send Theresa an email at [tlaverty {at} nmsu.edu](mailto:tlaverty@nmsu.edu) containing a short explanation of an idea you'd like to pursue, a pathway for pursuing it (e.g., a link to a funding source), and a CV with contact information for at least three references.
