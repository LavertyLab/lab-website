### Theresa Laverty

Theresa Laverty (she/her) is an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Fish, Wildlife and Conservation Ecology](https://fwce.nmsu.edu/) at [New Mexico State University](https://nmsu.edu/). Her research answers questions rooted in applied population and community ecology and often takes place outside of protected areas where humans, livestock, and wildlife interact. While she has studied diverse species (e.g., beach-nesting birds, caiman, red squirrels, elephants, and mountain gorillas), Theresa's research for the last decade has largely focused on bats. In addition to the southwestern United States, she has worked extensively in parts of Africa (Namibia, Madagascar, Kenya, and Uganda) as well as the Peruvian Amazon. She combines ecological research with social science methods to understand the basic ecology of a system, including the roles people play in the environment, in hopes of providing information that can assist managers and conservation scientists to make informed decisions. Prior to NMSU, Theresa was a postdoctoral scholar at Colorado State University and the University of Chicago. She holds a Ph.D. in [Fish, Wildlife, and Conservation Biology](https://warnercnr.colostate.edu/fwcb/) from Colorado State University and a B.A. in [Ecology and Evolutionary Biology](https://eeb.princeton.edu/) from Princeton University. When she is not behind a computer or out in the field, Theresa enjoys all things outdoors—trail running, backpacking, fishing, photographing wildlife, etc.

### Flor Calderón

Flor Calderón (she/her) joined the lab in spring 2026 as a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences](https://pes.nmsu.edu/). Her research addresses the effects of renewable energy development (wind and solar facilities) on bat activity and behavior in New Mexico. Flor holds a B.S. in Wildlife, Fish and Conservation Biology (2016) from the University of California, Davis. She also earned her M.S. in Biology in 2025 from Angelo State University, where she used GPS transmitters to study the foraging habitat and movement of the endangered Mexican long-nosed bat. Flor’s journey into bat biology began long before graduate school, shaped by over a decade of seasonal fieldwork across the western United States. She has worked with bats in deserts, mountains, and forests for federal, state, and private organizations. These experiences deepened her appreciation for both the creatures she studies and the diverse landscapes they inhabit. Although a bat person through and through, Flor also has experience working with small mammals, mesocarnivores (e.g., the endangered black-footed ferret), birds, and desert plants. As a Southern California native, she loves rock concerts, beach days, and a blend of outdoor adventures and backcountry leisure, such as glamping and lounging in large bodies of water.

### Ryan Moore

Ryan Moore (he/him) joined the lab in spring 2026 as a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences](https://pes.nmsu.edu/). His research focuses on the spatial ecology of bat and bird communities in relation to ephemeral water sources in the Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts. Ryan completed both his B.S. in Fish and Wildlife Conservation (2020) and M.S. in Forest Resources and Environmental Conservation (2023) at Virginia Tech. For his Master’s work, he investigated bog turtle wetland hydrology and its influence on how bog turtles utilize these fen wetlands. As an undergraduate and graduate student, he was able to work on several long-term phenology, occupancy, and population demography projects for amphibian and small mammal species in the Florida Panhandle and Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia. Following graduation, he worked as a field technician with Oregon State University surveying the Coastal and Cascade Ranges for terrestrial and stream-associated amphibians. Prior to joining the lab, he lived on Sanibel Island, Florida, trapping and tracking Sanibel Island Rice Rats with the University of Florida. Ryan enjoys hiking, playing guitar, and traveling.

### Holly Whited

Holly Whited (she/her) joined the lab in fall 2023 as a master’s student in the [Department of Fish, Wildlife and Conservation Ecology](https://fwce.nmsu.edu/). Broadly, her research centers on the ecology of bats in the Southwest. She received her B.S. in Wildlife Management from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville in 2022. While an undergraduate, she conducted research on secondary seed dispersal by small mammals in Southern Appalachia, completed internships surveying for bats with a state agency, and collected foraging data on an endangered bat species alongside a graduate student. Holly has also volunteered her time with the Tennessee Bat Working Group and Southeastern Bat Working Group, where she gained experiences surveying caves, swabbing bats for white-nose syndrome, harp trapping, tagging, and tracking bats with radio telemetry. Before moving to New Mexico, she spent a summer working for a consulting agency on a variety of projects with bats across the eastern United States and assisted on a project trapping and radio tagging eastern spotted skunks.
