      "contents": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJoin the Lab\r\n\r\nThanks for your interest in the Laverty Lab! Funded graduate student and postdoc openings in our group will be listed below as well as advertised on job boards, such as the Texas A&M Wildlife and Fisheries Sciences job board.\r\nWhile a background in the kind of work we do is always a leg up in hiring, Theresa particularly values independence, curiosity, and some awe at the natural world. We aim to cultivate a lab culture and scientific practice that is equitable and welcoming of diversity in all its dimensions, including class, gender identity and sexual orientation, race and ethnicity, and life experiences – please see the note on values. New Mexico is home to 23 Tribal Nations, and our lab is committed to providing opportunities to Indigenous students.\r\nProspective undergrads:\r\nThe Laverty Lab is always willing to work with eager and motivated NMSU undergraduate researchers. If you are interested in working in our lab, please send Theresa an email at tlaverty {at} nmsu.edu or stop by her office, Knox Hall 127, to discuss your research interests and any potential project ideas. Also consider visiting the links listed under Beyond our Lab to explore other research opportunities outside our group.\r\nProspective graduate students:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nM.S. and Ph.D. students at New Mexico State University are typically supported by a mix of teaching and research assistantships. Right now, both M.S. and Ph.D. students receive a ~$2,000 / month stipend. Theresa budgets for the cost of tuition and health insurance whenever possible in grant applications. The Laverty Lab’s ability to take on graduate students (and particularly Ph.D. students) is therefore contingent on the availability of funding. She will not support students’ applications without adequate funding.\r\nThis publication provides a nice overview of what applying to grad school looks like in our field. We highly recommend that you review it before contacting Theresa (or any other potential advisor).\r\n\r\nAll funded graduate positions in the lab are full at this time. However, if you are interested in securing your own funding as you apply for graduate programs and research interests overlap, Theresa is happy to assist with fellowship applications to programs, such as the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program, the US Fulbright Program, and the DOE Computational Science Graduate Fellowship. Similarly, Theresa would be happy to work with prospective international students on applications for the Fulbright Foreign Student Program, a WWF Russell E. Train Fellowship, or other opportunities. If you want to pursue a fellowship application, send an email to tlaverty {at} nmsu.edu containing a short explanation of an idea you’d like to pursue, a pathway for pursuing it (e.g., a link to a funding source), and a CV with contact information for at least three references.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProspective postdocs:\r\nThere are no funded postdoc positions available in the lab at this time. However, Theresa is happy to work with any interested individuals on related fellowship or grant applications to secure independent funding (via a NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology, a David H. Smith Conservation Research Fellowship, a L’Oreal USA Women in Science Fellowship, etc.). If you are interested in pursuing this option, send Theresa an email at tlaverty {at} nmsu.edu containing a short explanation of an idea you’d like to pursue, a pathway for pursuing it (e.g., a link to a funding source), and a CV with contact information for at least three references.\r\nBeyond our lab:\r\nIf you are interested in finding research positions when opportunities are limited in our lab, you may want to explore the following job boards:\r\nTexas A&M Wildlife and Fisheries Sciences job board\r\nEcoEvoJobs.net\r\nQueer Outdoor & Environmental job board\r\nNSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates\r\nUSAJOBS\r\nECOLOG-L listserv (note you need to register first for access- instructions here)\r\nMAMMAL-L listserv (note you need to register first for access- instructions here)\r\nSociety for Conservation Biology job board\r\nPrimate-jobs\r\nWildlife Disease Association job board\r\nSociety for Integrative & Comparative Biology job board\r\nIDDjobs\r\nOrnithology Exchange job board\r\nSociety for Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics & Native Americans in Science job board\r\nThe Wildlife Society job board\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Laverty, Ph.D.\r\nTheresa Laverty (she/her) is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Fish, Wildlife and Conservation Ecology at New Mexico State University. Her research answers questions rooted in applied population and community ecology and often takes place outside of protected areas where humans, livestock, and wildlife interact. While she has studied diverse species (e.g., beach-nesting birds, caiman, red squirrels, elephants, and mountain gorillas), Theresa’s research for the last decade has largely focused on bats. In addition to the southwestern United States, she has worked extensively in parts of Africa (Namibia, Madagascar, Kenya, and Uganda) as well as the Peruvian Amazon. She combines ecological research with social science methods to understand the basic ecology of a system, including the roles people play in the environment, in hopes of providing information that can assist managers and conservation scientists to make informed decisions. Prior to NMSU, Theresa was a postdoctoral scholar at Colorado State University and the University of Chicago. She holds a PhD in Fish, Wildlife, and Conservation Biology from Colorado State University and a BA in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from Princeton University. When she is not behind a computer or out in the field, Theresa enjoys all things outdoors—trail running, backpacking, fishing, photographing wildlife, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CV\r\n\r\n\r\n Google Scholar\r\n\r\n\r\n ORCID\r\n\r\n\r\n Research Gate\r\n\r\n\r\n GitHub\r\n\r\n\r\n Bluesky\r\n\r\n\r\n Knox Hall 127\r\n\r\n\r\n  tlaverty {at} nmsu.edu\r\n\r\n\r\nGraduate Students\r\n\r\n\r\nMorgan Monroe\r\nMorgan Monroe (she/her) joined the lab in spring 2025 as a Master’s student co-advised by Dr. Jennifer Frey in the Department of Fish, Wildlife and Conservation Ecology.

Using demographic (age at first reproduction, litter size, interbirth interval) and age-frequency data, we analyze population viability and trajectories using derivations from stage-structured Lefkovitch matrices. These results can allow for a more quantitative comparison and prioritization of management needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

By understanding human values and attitudes toward wildlife as well as the frequency and types of interactions with varying species, we try to highlight conservation challenges and opportunities. We are also interested in cultural stories about wildlife as these may influence future conservation attitudes and behaviors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

We study wildlife behavior at the individual-, population-, and community-levels, often with the goal of sustainably conserving biological diversity. We also value the diversity of people with whom we engage and aim to make our research (data, code, and findings) available to broad audiences.\r\nThis page borrows heavily from the superb lab value statements of the Poisot Lab at the Université de Montréal and the Brook Lab at the University of Chicago.\r\nLand Acknowledgment\r\nNew Mexico State University honors Native American knowledges and worldviews based on intimate relationships to the natural world. The genesis of the Southwest Indigenous Peoples, including the Pueblo, Navajo, and Apache, established their guardianship of the lands now occupied by New Mexico State University. As the state’s Land-Grant University, we acknowledge and respect the sovereign Indian Nations and Indigenous Peoples. We pledge to have a meaningful and respectful relationship with the sovereign Indian Nations, Indigenous communities, and Native American Peoples within the institution. The Laverty Lab also promises to extend these relationships to the Indigenous communities that have called and/or continue to call our study areas home.\r\nCode of conduct\r\nThe Laverty Lab is dedicated to a harassment- and discrimination-free experience for everyone. We recognize and celebrate that a diverse and inclusive scientific community is more productive, innovative, and impactful. We welcome and encourage diversity in our group.\r\nWe aim to foster a positive learning environment within our lab group and when collaborating with others. Accordingly, everyone who participates in any Laverty Lab project is expected to show respect and courtesy not only to other lab members, but also to their broader academic/social community at all times.\r\nWe ask that all members of our lab to conform to the following Code of Conduct.\r\nBe kind to yourself. Be mindful of your limits and do not exhaust yourself.\r\nBe kind to others. Do not insult or put down other contributors.\r\nBe inclusive. Give everyone a chance to talk and an opportunity to contribute.\r\nBe culturally sensitive. Actively listen and learn from others’ lived experiences.\r\nBehave professionally — both online and in person. Remember that inappropriate jokes and behaviors are not tolerated.\r\nAcknowledge contributions to our work, and cite the ideas of others. Don’t pretend we work in a vacuum.\r\nRespect privacy and confidentiality in cases where data or research products contain sensitive information. Do no harm.\r\nRemember that research developed within the lab, especially when it involves multiple lab members, is a collective good, and that using it for spin-off ideas must have explicit consent of all persons involved.\r\nAdvising Philosophy\r\nTo learn more about Theresa’s advising philosophy and expectations of graduate students, please visit this working document.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
