Laverty, Ph.D.\nTheresa Laverty (she/her) will be joining the Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Conservation Ecology at the New Mexico State University in January 2023 as an Assistant Professor. She is currently wrapping up a postdoc in the Brook Lab at the University of Chicago. Her research answers questions rooted in applied population and community ecology and often takes place outside of protected areas – where humans, livestock, and wildlife interact. While she has studied diverse species (e.g., beach-nesting birds, caiman, red squirrels, elephants, and mountain gorillas), Theresa’s research for the last decade has largely focused on bats. In addition to the southwestern United States, she has worked extensively in parts of Africa (Namibia, Madagascar, Kenya, and Uganda) as well as the Peruvian Amazon. She combines ecological research with social science methods to understand the basic ecology of a system, including the roles people play in the environment, in hopes of providing information that can assist managers and conservation scientists to make informed management decisions. Theresa holds a PhD in Fish, Wildlife, and Conservation Biology from Colorado State University and a BA in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from Princeton University. When she is not behind a computer or out in the field, Theresa enjoys all things outdoors—trail running, backpacking, photographing wildlife, etc.\n\n\n\n CV\n\n\n Google Scholar\n\n\n ORCID\n\n\n Research Gate\n\n\n GitHub\n\n\n Twitter\n\n\n  tlaverty [at] uchicago.edu\n\n\nStudents\n\n\nThis Could Be You!\nOur lab is currently recruiting students.

Our research has focused on abiotic (non-living) and biotic (living) factors that influence species distributions in relatively untouched landscapes, including factors such as water quality and the activity of sympatric ecosystem engineers or local food availability. In areas where species coexist with larger densities of humans and livestock, we also assess social factors that may affect species distributions and conservation (see “Evaluating the social dimensions of wildlife conservation”).\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValues\n\nWelcome to the Laverty Lab! We study wildlife behavior at the population- and community-levels, often with the goal of sustainably conserving biological diversity. We also value the diversity of people with whom we engage and aim to make our research (data, code, and findings) available to broad audiences.\nThis page borrows heavily from the superb lab value statements of the Poisot Lab at the Université de Montréal and the Brook Lab at the University of Chicago.\nCode of conduct\nThe Laverty Lab is dedicated to a harassment- and discrimination-free experience for everyone. We recognize and celebrate that a diverse and inclusive scientific community is more productive, innovative, and impactful. We welcome and encourage diversity in our group.\nWe aim to foster a positive learning environment within our lab group and when collaborating with others. Accordingly, everyone who participates in any Laverty Lab project is expected to show respect and courtesy not only to other lab members, but also to their broader academic/social community at all times.\nWe ask that all members of our lab to conform to the following Code of Conduct.\nBe kind to yourself. Be mindful of your limits, and do not exhaust yourself.\nBe kind to others. Do not insult or put down other contributors.\nBe inclusive. Give everyone a chance to talk and an opportunity to contribute.\nBe culturally sensitive. Actively listen and learn from others’ lived experiences.\nBehave professionally — both online and in person. Remember that inappropriate jokes and behaviors are not tolerated.\nAcknowledge contributions to our work, and cite the ideas of others. Don’t pretend we work in a vacuum.\nRespect privacy and confidentiality in cases where data or research products contain sensitive information. Do no harm.\nRemember that research developed within the lab, especially when it involves multiple lab members, is a collective good, and that using it for spin-off ideas must have explicit consent of all persons involved.\nFlexible working hours and locations\nWe recognize that our group is composed of self-motivated and ambitious scientists that may choose to deviate from a traditional 9 to 5 workday in order to meet our collective goals. We may respond to emails at odd hours, but have no expectation of others to work or respond outside of their normal working hours.\nThe flexibility of working hours and locations are some of the lifestyle perks of academia. Lab members may choose to work outside of their office and hold meetings outdoors, off-campus, or over phone/video calls.\nResearch is project-based work, and we recognize that some weeks are long and intense - particularly when it comes to fieldwork - while others less so. We expect that members of our group work hard and take advantage of opportunities, but also encourage work-life balance. We encourage everyone to attend our lab meetings and to participate to lab activities.\n\n\n\n",
