In January 2023, Theresa Laverty will be beginning an assistant professor position in the [Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Conservation Ecology](https://fwce.nmsu.edu/) at New Mexico State University. Theresa is currently a postdoctoral scholar in the [Department of Ecology & Evolution](https://ecologyandevolution.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago. 

Theresa's research answers questions rooted in applied population and community ecology and often takes place outside of protected areas -- where humans, livestock, and wildlife interact. Her goal is to understand the basic ecology of a system, including the roles people play in the environment, in hopes of providing information that can assist managers and conservation scientists to make informed management decisions.

When Theresa is not behind a computer or out in the field, she enjoy all things outdoorsâ€”trail running, backpacking, cross country skiing, photographing wildlife, etc.
