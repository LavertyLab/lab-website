## Teaching

The opportunity to teach and mentor undergraduate and graduate students is a tremendous privilege and responsibility. I am committed to providing high quality classroom learning and mentoring experiences that train students to become natural resource leaders. In my teaching, I reflect on my own experiences as a first-generation college student to prioritize inclusive pedagogy and active learning. I teach to foster lasting learning by incorporating principles from memory research into the field, lecture, and laboratory components of the courses that I offer .
